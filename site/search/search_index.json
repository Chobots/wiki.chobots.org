Chobots was a family\u2011friendly MMO launched in the late 2000s where players took on the role of colourful alien beings exploring floating cities in space. The game encouraged creativity and community \u2014 players could chat, play mini\u2011games, complete quests, adopt pets and decorate their own homes. Although the official game shut down in 2011, its spirit lives on through private servers, remakes and fan projects.

Aims This project is focused on preserving the game and its source code as faithfully as possible to Chobot's original .com version. The goal is to improve the game's stability and ease of operation without altering its original features or behaviour. The .com version contained numerous bugs and exploits, and part of this project's objective is to patch these issues to ensure the game can be safely run for archival purposes. This project does not aim to introduce new features or make modifications that did not exist in the original .com version. Such enhancements may be addressed by separate projects in future. Roadmap and Goals Goals of this project are as follows but not limited to: [x] Publish the source code [x] Docker Compose setup to allow code to be easily compiled and run [ ] Replicating the .com website [ ] Replicating the .com blog [ ] Pre-population of minimal database including servers, clothes, word lists, sensible configuration [ ] Upgrading ancient dependencies or implementing patches to mitigate CVEs [ ] Ensuring that admin RTMP calls (many) can only be made by authorised users [ ] Ensuring that XMLRPC calls require authentication [ ] Ensuring that sensitive client RTMP calls (many) such as retriveItem are server validated to avoid abuse [ ] Produce detailed software architecture documents [ ] Salt and hash passwords [ ] Server-side validation of superuser commands [ ] Safely enable guest accounts & patch specific guest exploits [ ] Fix partner login [ ] Reauthenticate client server moves (including first login) via auth tokens rather than client stored password Running the code [!CAUTION] Until our efforts progress, this source contains numerous potentially extremely dangerous vulnerabilities. Running this code locally, even if not published publicly, may expose you to security issues. Users run this code at their own risk.
