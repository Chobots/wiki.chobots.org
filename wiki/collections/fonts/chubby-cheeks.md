## Overview

Chubby Cheeks is a playful TrueType font created by **James Shields**, who distributes it for free personal use[^1].  It appeared on font sites as early as the late 1990s and is usually classified as a “Cartoon/Comic” font[^1].  Shields explains that he designed his early fonts with Corel Draw and later the Softy font editor, and he encourages people to share what they create with his fonts[^2].

## Role in Chobots

In the **Chobots** MMO, Chubby Cheeks served as the **primary display typeface**.  It was used widely in the game’s user interface, promotional materials and official Flash banners.  When players created blogs or “guide” sites on platforms like Blogger/Blogspot, they could embed Chobots banners that showcased the Chubby Cheeks lettering, making the font synonymous with the Chobots community’s identity.
