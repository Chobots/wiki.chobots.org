# Homes

![House with Colour Shower and Island Addons](../img/chobotshomeregular.png)

**Homes** were available to every Chobot upon registration. They could be accessed via the Map on the right-hand side or in the bottom left of the user's interface—unless the user was already inside their home.

---

## 🪑 Furniture

**Furniture** was available from the beginning, with more items added over time. Users could purchase furniture and place it throughout their home.

Some furniture items were **interactable**, such as the **Arcade Machines**, which allowed you to purchase and play games found at the Arcade off of [Café Street](../loc3).
