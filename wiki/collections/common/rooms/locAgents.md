# Agents HQ

Agents HQ was a **private room** added in **March 2009**, announced in this [blog post](http://chobots2.blogspot.com/2009/03/agents-headquarters.html).

This room was **not accessible to regular players** unless they had obtained **Agent status**. Occasionally, during moderator events, a staff member might use the `#moveTo` command to teleport players directly into the HQ.

It was located **beneath the Park**, accessible through the **Blue Pipe** inside the Agent Graphity Tunnel — though the animation was only visible to Agents.

## Agent Catalog

The main feature of this room was the **exclusive Agent Catalog**, containing the rare Fireboots, and unique items only purchasable by Chobots Agents.

## Conclusion

Agents HQ served as the **official base** for Agents, offering a sense of mystery and exclusivity. With its limited access, it became one of the most **elusive** rooms in the game — often referenced in blogs and agent promotions.
