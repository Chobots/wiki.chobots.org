## The Café

The Café was one of the buildings in Café Street, featuring various tables and chairs where players could sit and chat with each other, and purchase drinks. The Café was decorated with a cozy and inviting atmosphere, complete with hanging lights. 

The Café also contained a mini-game called **Coin Rain**, a fast-paced puzzle game where players earned points by clicking on groups of matching-colored coins before the timer ran out. The more coins cleared in a single move, the higher the score.

Coin Rain was loosely based on classic "SameGame" or "Collapse"-style mechanics and was a popular choice for casual players looking to earn coins quickly.

## Gamezone
