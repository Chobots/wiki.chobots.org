# Chobots Source Code Preservation Project

[Website](https://www.chobots.org) | [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PKcdQTfhc8)

This repository is a source code preservation project for the original `.com` version of Chobots, created by Vayersoft in 2008 and abandoned in 2011.

# Aims

This project is focused on preserving the game and its source code as faithfully as possible to Chobot's original `.com` version. The goal is to improve the game's stability and ease of operation without altering its original features or behaviour. The `.com` version contained numerous bugs and exploits, and part of this project's objective is to patch these issues to ensure the game can be safely run for archival purposes.

This project does not aim to introduce new features or make modifications that did not exist in the original `.com` version. Such enhancements may be addressed by separate projects in future.

# Roadmap and Goals

Goals of this project are as follows but not limited to:

 - [x] Publish the source code
 - [x] Docker Compose setup to allow code to be easily compiled and run
 - [ ] Replicating the .com website
 - [ ] Replicating the .com blog
 - [ ] Pre-population of minimal database including servers, clothes, word lists, sensible configuration
 - [ ] Upgrading ancient dependencies or implementing patches to mitigate CVEs
 - [ ] Ensuring that admin RTMP calls (many) can only be made by authorised users
 - [ ] Ensuring that XMLRPC calls require authentication
 - [ ] Ensuring that sensitive client RTMP calls (many) such as `retriveItem` are server validated to avoid abuse
 - [ ] Produce detailed software architecture documents
 - [ ] Salt and hash passwords
 - [ ] Server-side validation of superuser commands
 - [ ] Safely enable guest accounts & patch specific guest exploits
 - [ ] Fix partner login
 - [ ] Reauthenticate client server moves (including first login) via auth tokens rather than client stored password
