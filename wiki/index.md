## What is Chobots?

Chobots was a family‚Äëfriendly MMO launched in the late 2000s where players took on the role of colourful alien beings exploring floating cities in space.  The game encouraged creativity and community ‚Äî players could chat, play mini‚Äëgames, complete quests, adopt pets and decorate their own homes.  Although the official game shut down in 2011, its spirit lives on through private servers, remakes and fan projects.

## Our mission

The **Chobots Archive Organization** exists to preserve and document everything related to the original game ‚Äî from source code and assets and historical articles.  At the same time, we‚Äôre making development easier for new contributors by providing a clean codebase, up‚Äëto‚Äëdate documentation and modern deployment tools.

- **Preservation:** We maintain a complete snapshot of the original Chobots (.com) version in our GitHub repositories, fix security issues and make it easy to spin up a local instance.
- **Community:** We welcome fans, historians and developers alike.  If you‚Äôd like to help, check out our GitHub organization and join the discord!
