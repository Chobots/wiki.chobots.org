<h1 align="center">The Chobots Wiki</h1>
<p align="center">
  A community-led effort to preserve the world of <strong>Chobots</strong> — a family‑friendly MMO launched in the late 2000s where players took on the role of colourful alien beings exploring floating cities in space. The game encouraged creativity and community — players could chat, play mini‑games, complete quests, adopt pets, decorate homes, draw on a graffiti wall, and much more!

Our goal is to archive both technical and community information from the original game, with an emphasis on:
